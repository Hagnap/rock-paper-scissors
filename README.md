## Description
This website is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game. To play this you must use the Console in the Inspector that is accessible via your browser. 
It uses HTML to create an empty webpage and JavaScript is used to handle the logic. The purpose of the webpage was to practice JavaScript skills so it is very bare-bones.
